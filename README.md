# MatrixReducer
Performs Gauss-Jordan elimination on a user-input matrix.

This is one of my oldest programs and not very well-documented.

However, it exactly follows the steps a human would follow to solve a matrix using Gauss-Jordan reduction. The function names make it relatively self-explanatory.
